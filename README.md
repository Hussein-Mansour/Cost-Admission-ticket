# Cost-Admission-ticket
Project For Fun!

A company would like an object-oriented program that calculates the cost of an admission ticket, based on the age of the customer. The user will be prompted to enter the age, then the program output will be the price for a single ticket.

newborns, infants, toddlers		 zero (inclusive) to 3 years (exclusive)		free admission
child, youth				           3 to 13 years (both inclusive)			$7.99
adult				                   14 (inclusive) to 65 years (exclusive)		$10.99
senior				                 65 years or older (inclusive)			$8.50

Any age entered that is less than zero, or greater than or equal to 110 should result in the program outputting an “Invalid Age Entered” error message instead of a price.
